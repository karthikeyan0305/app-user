App User Behavior Segmentation Using Unsupervised Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing large-scale app user activity data and grouping users based on their behavioral patterns using unsupervised machine learning techniques.

Since the dataset does not contain predefined labels such as active users or churned users, clustering is applied to automatically discover meaningful user segments.
These segments help businesses understand engagement levels, detect at-risk users, and design personalized strategies.

🎯 Problem Statement

Applications generate huge amounts of user interaction data, but understanding behavior without predefined labels is challenging.

This project aims to:

Identify groups of users with similar engagement patterns

Detect high-value and low-engagement users

Support retention strategies and targeted marketing

Enable data-driven product decisions

🧠 Machine Learning Approach
✔ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handled missing values

Selected behavioral numerical features

Removed non-informative attributes

✔ Feature Engineering

Selected engagement-driven metrics such as sessions, duration, activity scores, and interaction counts

✔ Feature Scaling

Applied StandardScaler to normalize features

Ensured equal contribution in distance-based clustering

✔ Clustering Model

Used K-Means Clustering to group users based on behavioral similarity

✔ Optimal Cluster Selection

Applied Elbow Method using inertia values

Identified 4 clusters as optimal

✔ Dimensionality Reduction

Used PCA to visualize cluster separation in 2D space

✔ Cluster Profiling

Users were categorized into:

High Engagement Users – frequent sessions, strong interaction, low churn risk

Moderate Users – consistent but average activity

Low / At-Risk Users – low engagement and higher churn probability

Occasional Users – irregular usage patterns

💼 Business Impact

This project enables:

🎯 Targeted marketing campaigns

🔁 Early churn detection

⭐ Personalized user experience

📈 Feature optimization decisions

📊 Data-driven product strategies
